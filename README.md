Switch between sibling projects in the same folder using the same opened window!

## Usage

Just press `cmd-;`(if you're in a Mac machine) or `ctrl-;` for Linux/Windows users.
Some users have the cedilla `รง` in their keyboard, this key's in the place where
`;` is in most of the keyboards. Users that have `รง` in their keyboard must use
`ctrl-รง` instead of `ctrl-;`, due to this change.

## TODO

* Add option in package settings to switch between opening in same/another window;
* Use `ctrl-;` whether users' keyboard have `รง` or not.
* Make it work with multiple folders in project
