Switch between sibling projects in the same folder using the same opened window!

## Usage

Just press `cmd-;`(if you're in a Mac machine) or `ctrl-;` for Linux/Windows users.
Some users have the cedilla key (`รง`) in their keyboard, this key's in the place where
`;` is in US keyboards. Users that have `รง` in their keyboard can use both
`ctrl-รง` and `ctrl-;`.
